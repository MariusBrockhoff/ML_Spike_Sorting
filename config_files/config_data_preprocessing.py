    preparation, model training, and clustering, tailored to the specific requirements
    of the model and dataset.

    Attributes:
        data_path (str): The file path for the dataset used in pretraining.
        MODEL_TYPE (str): The type of model being pretrained.
        FILE_NAME (str): Extracted file name from `data_path`, used for saving the model.

        # Data Preparation Parameters
        DATA_SAVE_PATH (str): The path where processed data will be saved.
        DATA_PREP_METHOD (str): Method used for data preparation, set to "gradient".
        DATA_NORMALIZATION (str): Type of data normalization to apply, set to "MinMax".
        TRAIN_TEST_SPLIT (float): The ratio of train to test data split.
        BENCHMARK_START_IDX (int): The starting index for benchmarking.
        BENCHMARK_END_IDX (int): The ending index for benchmarking, based on the train-test split ratio.

        # Reconstruction Parameters
        LEARNING_RATE (float): The initial learning rate for model training.
        WITH_WARMUP (bool): Flag to determine if learning rate warmup should be used.
        LR_WARMUP (int): Number of epochs for learning rate warmup.
        LR_FINAL (float): Final learning rate after warmup.
        NUM_EPOCHS (int): Total number of epochs for training.
        BATCH_SIZE (int): Batch size used for training.
        EARLY_STOPPING (bool): Whether to use early stopping.
        PATIENCE (int): Number of epochs to wait for improvement before early stopping.
        MIN_DELTA (float): Minimum change to quantify an improvement.
        BASELINE (int): Baseline value for training metrics.

        # Regularization Parameters
        WITH_WD (bool): Flag to determine if weight decay regularization is used.
        WEIGHT_DECAY (float): Initial value for weight decay.
        WD_FINAL (float): Final value for weight decay after training.

        # Clustering Parameters
        CLUSTERING_METHOD (str): Clustering algorithm to use, set to "Kmeans".
        N_CLUSTERS (int): Number of clusters to form in clustering.
        EPS (float or None): Epsilon parameter for clustering algorithms, if applicable.
        MIN_CLUSTER_SIZE (int): Minimum size for a cluster.
        KNN (int): Number of nearest neighbors to consider in clustering algorithms.

        # Model Saving Parameters
        SAVE_WEIGHTS (bool): Whether to save the model weights after training.
        SAVE_DIR (str): The directory path to save the pretrained model.
